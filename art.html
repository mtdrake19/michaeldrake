		<p id="mayo">Chicago's Art museum holds many of the world's most treasurable masterpieces. These pieces include cultures of; African, American, Ancient Egyptian, Architecture and Design, European Arts & Sculpture, and Asian. Each culture section in art takes you through the background, art, and history of that culture. Infact, African culture played a huge role in arts in Chicago. As you browse through the museum in the African/American section, it mentions that black or urban culture moved from the South to Chicago between 1910-1960. While this move enabled alot of controversy from caucasions, it enabled the opportunity for Chicago to be exposed to art in many forms. Including paintings, jazz music, food, etc. This foundation brought taste and culture to Chicago, and continues to grow to this very day. </p>
