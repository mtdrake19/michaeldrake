<h2>ABOUT THE THE WINDY CITY!</h2>
<section>
<p id="para1">Chicago is one of the world's greatest places to visit. As you browse through, 
I hope you are amazed by the history, culture, and activities Chicago has to offer.</p>

<p id="para2">There are many attractions in Chicago ranging from food to culture. However, 
the main attraction, and the first stop of 99% of tourists that first come here is the Willis Tower.
Originally named the Sears Tower, you have the option to literally hover over the city on a
glass surface. Scared of heights? That's alright, because you can be grounded and still discover the best of Chicago
in Navy Pier. With mini golf, cruise ships, and playlands for children, the option for entertainment seems 
endless. </p>

<p id="para3">As a visitor or local resident, don't forget to check out the local concerts and festivals that goes on
such as Lalapalooza and the Taste of Chicago. </p>
