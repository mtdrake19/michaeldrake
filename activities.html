<h2>THINGS TO DO!</h2>
<section>
<p id="fatboy">Chicago provides virtually everything for personal enjoyment such as biking, basketball, running, and swimming.</p>
<p id="wwe">Although activities are dominantly held downtown,
they can be held in all parts of Chicago, including suburban areas.
Chicago is also home to the United Center, which holds wrestling events, and you
also get the opportunity to watch the Chicago Bulls&copy play here.
</p>
<p id="mike">Don't forget  to check out the Chicago theater as well, holding plays virtually every week by the most famous artists. Afterwards, you can enjoy a nice ctuise at Navy Pier to complete your day.</p>
